        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p class="bigP">JQuery was first released in August 2006 by John Resig at BarCamp NYC. Resig, a young web developer at the time, had a vision: he wanted to make web development easier by simplifying how developers interacted with JavaScript and the DOM (Document Object Model). His goal was to create a library that would not only streamline common scripting tasks but also resolve browser compatibility issues, which were rampant at the time. By the late 2000s, jQuery became the dominant JavaScript library used by developers worldwide. Its adoption skyrocketed thanks to its ease of use and robust community support. Websites big and small, including platforms like WordPress, Drupal, and even large corporations, integrated jQuery into their projects.</p>
