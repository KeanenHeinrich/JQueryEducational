This project was a revisitting of Javascript specifically in the interest of experimenting with JQuery.
Ive always admired those in web development that are able to create stunningly interactive pages that give
a lot of tactile feedback to the user, and so I'm glad to have added this animation library to my repetoire.

The web site itself is rather simple, just an educational web site teaching exactly what I was experimenting with.
If I could critique myself, I would say that my desire for a consistent page layout got in the way of trying particularly
"out there" animations and webpage designs.

Considering that websites and web-applications are one of my personal areas of interest from a development standpoint, I
found JQuery to be a valuable addition to my toolbox when trying to create dynamic and visually interesting websites.
